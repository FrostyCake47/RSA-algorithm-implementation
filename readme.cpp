PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING POINTS ABOUT THE PROGRAM


Several variables in the program which should take random values each time we generate a key are explicitly given values.

This is due to the size limitation of the int data type as values become enormously large as exponentiation takes place during encryption and decryption processes.

Even though certain functions were defined to generate certain values, they are obsolete in this scenario. They are marked as commands rather than erasing completely.


Many changes were made in the later stages in order to limit the values.


Thank you.
